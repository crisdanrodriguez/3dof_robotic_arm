# 3DOF Robotic Arm

A 3 degrees of freedom manipulator arm was implemented with the ability to achieve movement in at least a 10x10x10 cm cube. The robot is controlled from a PC using a graphical user interface. It has four operation modes: manual mode, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and trajectory planning.
